The goal of this project is to create a small 2D game where the player must collect items and reach an exit while avoiding obstacles. Students must use a [graphics library](https://harm-smits.github.io/42docs/libs/minilibx) to display the game, manage user input, and manipulate elements such as enemies, collectibles, and walls.
